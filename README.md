# NoitaLike_Particle_Simulator

Particle "simulator" inspired by the game Noita where different types of particles have different behaviour.

Sand will fall and pile up

Water will fall and try to fill the area it is in, until it is level.

Dirt will stay in the same place and act as a solid particle.

Currently, some optimizations may be in order, such as quadtree search for active particles to copmute, and parallel chunk computation.
